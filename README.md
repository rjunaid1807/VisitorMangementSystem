# VisitorManagementSystem

This Spring Boot application is built as an apartment management system that keeps track of visitor activity. The app provides endpoints for residents gatekeepers and admin. The gatekeeper can request on behalf of the visitor and the resident can approve it through the app.

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/).

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ, `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

Update your local database connection in `application.properties` or create your own `application-local.properties` file to override settings for development. I have git-ignored the application.proprties as it contains my Mysql configuration and password.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For this, in IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing - [learn more](https://bootify.io/next-steps/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

The application can then be started with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/visitor-management-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
